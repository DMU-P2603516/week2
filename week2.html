<h1>WHAT WE LOVE ABOUT CATS</h1>
There are dozens of reasons to love a cat. They are cute felines who keep you
company with their purr and fur. Not to mention their pretty eyes that reflect
the luminance of the moon.

<h1 style="color: #FFD500">They are cheap to feed</h1>
Perhaps you're on a budget but still wish to have a pet next to you. Well, cats
are easy to mantain as the nutrients they require to live are really cheap.

<h1 style="color: #FF0E00">They can be left alone</h1>
You don't always have the time to be home. You might have a busy routine and
staying home is not an option most of the times. If that's the case for you,
then having a cat is a recommended option as they can be left without supervision,
unlike other animals.

<h1 style="color: #09AF1B">They don't need to run outside</h1>
Cats don't require a routinely stroll in the park. Why? Because they themselves
don't enjoy it. They'd rather be indoors either napping or exploring the house.
However, if they require an adventure in the outside world, they don't necessarily
need your help, as they can leave without supervision and return without a scratch.
